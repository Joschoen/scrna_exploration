# scrna_exploration

This is just a small repository for the scrna_exploration script and following scripts. Nothing fancy just download the scrna_exploration_script.Rmd and find out.

The script comes with no guarantee that it works for your data. It's only tested on my own dataset. 

Dependencies:
ggplot2
Seurat v4 or higher
